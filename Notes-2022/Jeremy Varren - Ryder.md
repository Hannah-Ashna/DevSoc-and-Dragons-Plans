### Character Summary
A descendant of Vekron, Jeremy Varren is a (variant) human monk who regrets his families actions and has renounced much of this past. Although he still praises Arnie, he took to monkhood to avoid his past and took a new last name. He's pretty serious, likes to journal, make maps and hit things with his hands.
