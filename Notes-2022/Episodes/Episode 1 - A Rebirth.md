### The Sands of Time
```PLAY A NEW BEGINNING```
You all slowly begin to gain consciousness and as you gentle pry your eyes open a blinding white light scorches you. Pushing yourselves forward and up off the ground you sense a grainy texture on the palms of your hands as it presses into the floor. Around you is a vast, icy white desert. The dunes in the distance seem to go on and on, almost like they were never ending. As you force yourselves up from the rather unstable ground, you quickly realise that each of you is alone out here. There doesn't seem to be a single soul in sight in this bright, white void of a place. To be honest, you all can't seem to figure out how you even got here to begin with. Looking around and down at yourself you notice that all your items and weapons are gone. Did someone dump you out here? and if so, where even is here??? in all your years of life you've never even come across such a place in ... uh ... hmm.. where did you even come from?? Well this isn't good. You aren't even sure of who you are! 

As you begin to frantically search through your memories for answers the sand beneath you begins to quiver as a distant rumbling sound echoes through the desert. Locking your eyes with the only obvious movement you can see out here each of you sees a large marble pedestal start to slowly emerge from the ground a few feet away in-front of you. Something about it calls out to you ...

**Do you answer the call?**

### The Pedestal
Upon walking up to the pedestal you notice some sort of plaque with an inscription carved into it. The symbols are unlike anything you've ever seen before, yet for some reason you understand. It reads: 

All things are born for me.  
His father and his mother, –yet man hates  
         Me foolishly.  
An easy spirit and a free lives on,  
But he who fears the ice doth stumble.

### Time Resets
All of a sudden the ground begins to quake yet again except this time you notice the landscape seems to rotate in such an odd manner and now you're falling in reverse?? Did that pedestal destroy gravity?? A vortex of sand begins to form within the sky, slowly drawing you in. For a brief moment you are suffocated within heaps upon heaps of sand only to be spat out onto the ground. You're all not entirely sure of what just happened but now there's a spot in the centre of the sky that appears to be funnelling down sand. Perhaps that was just some weird hallucination, though you are quite sure you're hurt a little after being thrown about so violently by the sand like that. 

Contemplating your sanity prevents you from immediately noticing a robed figure that approaches each of you from behind. You hear them clear their throat which snaps you out of your thoughts immediately, whisking yourself in a 180 degree motion to face them with your guard up. They say nothing to you for a moment before gently extending a hand out towards you, as if to ask for your hand in theirs. 

**Do you accept their hand?** *If they don't then the figure reaches out and grabs onto their hand*
Their hand firms its grip on yours before pulling you closer, exposing your inner forearm. With their other hand, they reveal a glowing, crimson branding stick. Before you're able to react the hot brand is pressed firmly against your arm and all you can do is let out a horrific scream of agony. The burning ache sends your entire body into shock and all of you pass out. 

```STOP A NEW BEGINNING```

### Welcome to Purgatory
Everything is silent. You are now in a void of absolute darkness, it is cold and you've never felt so alone. 

```PLAY ARTIST'S GARRET - until they leave the house```
Then, there is a voice .... **Mokat speaks**

The players meet [[Mokat Irai the Necromancer|Mokat]]

**Why the weird circle in the room?** 
"Oh that? it randomly appeared here and out came the four of yous! It's usually how folks get sent to the afterlife but I'm surprised you've ended up here in purgatory"

### The River
As all of you wait by the dock for the Ferryman you notice a pale flickering light glistening through the thick fog. Gently, the creaking gondola begins to push its way past the curtains of fog slowly pulling up to the dock so that each of you may hop on board. 

**Do any of you look at the figure?** [[The Ferryman]] 
**Do you hop on board immediately or attempt to communicate with the ferryman?** He will stop you and ask for something of value but will then suggest that you may simply pay with a debt to him, a debt that he may call upon in the future.

```PLAY CROSSING THE STYX```
Once the deal has been made, the Ferryman skilfully pushes the gondola away from the dock using his staff and you begin your journey northward. The water is murky though it's hard to really see with this thick fog surrounding you. The lantern at the front of the gondola can only do so much. As the quiet rowing starts to calm each of you down from the rude awakening you've had so far you start to hear soft thudding sounds against the base of the boat.

**Do you inspect?** Upon a closer look to see past the boat's glass frame you begin to recognise what you believe are hundreds upon hundreds of hands weakly attempting to grasp onto the bottom of the boat. Occasionally the boat rocks at the force but the ferryman seems unbothered by this.

**Do you chose to sit still or investigate further?**
- If they touch the water -> DC 15 Strength Save or begin to be dragged into the water
- If they fail -> Life is drained from them and only the husk of their body remains

The journey is long or perhaps it just felt long since you spent it in the company of all the unsettling things stirring within the water. Once all of you hop off, the ferryman gestures goodbye and disappears within the fog once again. Up ahead looks to be some sort of old town.

```STOP CROSSING THE STYX```

**Whoever has the amulet** -> You can hear Moks voice in your head telling you to head on up the hill and towards the church, that is where we'll be able to meet with someone who might be able to resolve the party's issue.

### The Rising Figure
As all of you walk away towards the city and out of reach. Unbeknown to you, the murky water begins to bubble and out comes a dark shadow with piercing white eyes. The form it takes is indiscernible. The being begins to slowly trudge along to the trail left by your footprints. 

**Note:** None of you see this!

### The Church - Waiting Room
```PLAY CATHEDRAL```
After walking uphill for a couple of minutes you notice a tiny wooden sign that reads: JAHM-PASYIR. The buildings here give off a sort of macabre vibe, with their decaying rooftops, chiseled stone walls and foggy surroundings. You all hear a soft distant echo of prayer in the distance. Perhaps, it is the church that Mok spoke of. 

* None of the houses here 'real' they radiate illusion magic energy.
* If they open a door and try to step in the door immediately shuts behind them and whoever walks in gets teleported back to the front of the door.

The trail leading towards the sounds of prayer stops in front of a magnificent ash black Gothic chapel. It's windows are a direct contrast to the rest of the building's aesthetics as it contains colourful depictions of what can only be assumed to be stories of Death's adventurers told through stained glass. The large wooden door is left slightly ajar, allowing for the gentle hymns and murmurs from inside to come crawling out. 

**Do you enter?**
The inside of the chapel is perhaps just about if not more jaw-dropping compared to its outsides. There are rows upon rows of pews filled with an array of folks from all over the place. A single long red velvet carpet lines the dark wooden floors down the aisle. Large ornate chandeliers adorned with crystals and candles glisten up above, almost like a contained galaxy. Standing at the centre of attention by the altar is a familiar figure that begins to call out numbers. 

"398 ...... 399 .... 400...."

You're quite sure it's the Ferryman - [[The Ferryman#The Receptionist]]. 

Once all of you have entered the church the door behind you shuts. You can't seem to open it.
**Do you take a seat?**

As time goes on and you listen to these numbers get called out you watch as one by one, people sitting in the pews sit up and walk towards the large stained glass window at the back of the Ferryman by the altar. The ferryman reads out a number and you watch as an elderly woman rises from one of the frontmost pews. She walks to the large stained glass window behind the altar. As she presses a wrinkled hand to it the image in the glass morphs to a swamp bathed in red -- in it you see a weeping figure buried in the bloody earth. Before she can react shes absorbed into the glass before it ripples back into its previous form. 

**Do you go up to the glass and touch it?** Depending on how long they take we can say that a guard walks in, skips the supposed number queue and just taps on the glass before being transported elsewhere.
* You're unsure of how time works within this realm but it's felt like an eternity, the ferryman continues to drone on '56,789 .... 56,790 ..." none of you has been given a number to wait on and this church looks busy -- it might be a long time before anyone gets around to speaking with you and you're on a time limit! From the corner of your eye, Patro, you notice what you believe is one of death's soldiers, clad in a suit of armour enter from the doorway and march straight down the aisle. He presses his hand against the stained glass and is immediately transported elsewhere. 

### Dungeons
As you walk up to the stained glass window, no one in the room seems to object -- in fact the ferryman hasnt even bothered to look up at any of you as they continues on with their numbers ... as you put your palm up against the window, you watch as it begins to frantically switch between all sorts of images. They flash by too quickly but you manage to catch a glimpse of a white desert, a dark room with dark ooze dripping from the walls and a quiet little farm. Finally it stops at a dimly lit dungeon with a statue in the centre. The glass then begins to pull each of you in and within a blink you are all now face to face with this statue. 
```PLAY CATACOMBS```

#### The Statue Puzzle
In front of you is a carefully carved out stone statue of a soldier that is facing the way in which you entered this dungeon. Behind you is now a brick wall. The room has three gates all of which are closed at the moment. Above each gate is a painting of an empty dark room with a single candle in it. There is also another painting on the wall behind you and this is of the church that you just came from. The statue's gaze is currently focused on it. 

The space feels a claustrophobic with such a big looming figure occupying the centre of the room. The room is covered in cobwebs and you're quite sure that's dried up blood on the floor. At the base of the statue is a slightly damaged plaque that reads:

Fear me not, man; I am the blood that flows  
Within thee,–I am change

and then there's parts of it missing followed by:

Rising before thee: I it is can make  
         Old things give place  
         To thy free race.

* If the players attack the statue, it will fight back, but only for one round. Then, it freezes once more.
* Ask them to roll for initiative once

#### The Mirrored Rooms Puzzle
As each of you each of you enter the room, you see one of the others appear across from you, entering through an identical door. You glance around you see someone else having appeared through a different door to your left or right. You quickly realise that the room you are in has two mirrored walls, and your friends have walked into the mirrored versions of the same room you are in. 

Each of the rooms has a bookshelf, although the look of the books differ slightly between them. 

In the corner of every room is a small cage, suspended from a chain hooked to the ceiling

Against one wall is a empty basin, over which sits a stone bust of a dragons head attached to the wall. The dragon in room C's horns are missing. 

Each room also has a metal sconce mounted to the wall. 

Finally, every room has a small wooden table, with a different object and a small note. 
In A there is a chess set with a missing piece, the note reads "complete me". 
In B is a book, the note reads "place me"
In C is a ceramic jug, the note reads "fill me"
In D is a candelabra, the note reads "light me"

#### The Mystery Battle (Depends on time)
You enter a dingy room. You can see a pathway to your right, alongside a pillar. Your footsteps echo on the cracked stone floor. 

*DC 12 Perception check to find the slits in the wall where the boneless come out*

As you round the corner you see large stone statue of a knight in full plate armour.

You hear a whirring, followed by a whooshing and metallic clunk sound behind you as a iron gate slams in place in front of the door you just entered. The same happens for the door ahead of you.

*(if they are to fight the mimic - if they touch or walk in front of the statue)*
You see a crack form in the centre of the statue, that slowly widens, as you realize with rising horror that it is not a crack but a dripping mouth with rows of razor sharp teeth forming from this statue, and long black tentacle smashes into you
*(mimic gets surprise round)*

**Roll initiative.**

*(In the first turn for the boneless's initiative)* you hear a soft hissing sound from the walls

*(If they are not to fight the mimic and walk in front of the statue)* You hear whooshing noise as the statue lifts its shield, revealing for a brief moment, the carved face of a demon. From its mouth fires a pillar of flames.

All in front of the statue need to make a dex save *(DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one)*


### HR's Office
As you make your way down this dimly lit corridor, you notice that the grimy brick walls begin to glisten with a fresh coat of light blue paint. The sound of your boots hitting the cobble stone floor seems to shift into a gentle set of creaks and as you glance down you notice it's now all wood. In front of you is a figure sat under a pale yellow light behind a desk and as it looks up at you you get the odd sensation that it's smiling at you despite it's lack of ... well ... a *face*.

Welcome to the HR department of the underworld ... and your new friend here is [[The Manager]]
