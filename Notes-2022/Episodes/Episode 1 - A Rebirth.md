### The Sands of Time
You all slowly begin to gain consciousness and as you gentle pry your eyes open a blinding white light scorches you. Pushing yourselves forward and up off the ground you sense a grainy texture on the palms of your hands as it presses into the floor. Around you is a vast, icy white desert. The dunes in the distance seem to go on and on, almost like they were never ending. As you force yourselves up from the rather unstable ground, you quickly realise that each of you is alone out here. There doesn't seem to be a single soul in sight in this bright, white void of a place. To be honest, you all can't seem to figure out how you even got here to begin with. Looking around and down at yourself you notice that all your items and weapons are gone. Did someone dump you out here? and if so, where even is here??? in all your years of life you've never even come across such a place in ... uh ... hmm.. where did you even come from?? Well this isn't good. You aren't even sure of who you are! 

As you begin to frantically search through your memories for answers the sand beneath you begins to quiver as a distant rumbling sound echoes through the desert. Locking your eyes with the only obvious movement you can see out here each of you sees a large marble pedestal start to slowly emerge from the ground a few feet away in-front of you. Something about it calls out to you ...

**Do you answer the call?**

### The Pedestal
Upon walking up to the pedestal you notice some sort of plaque with an inscription carved into it. The symbols are unlike anything you've ever seen before, yet for some reason you understand. It reads: 

" (Insert Riddle Here about Death and second chances???)"

### Time Resets
All of a sudden the ground begins to quake yet again except this time you notice the landscape seems to rotate in such an odd manner and now you're falling in reverse?? Did that pedestal destroy gravity?? A vortex of sand begins to form within the sky, slowly drawing you in. For a brief moment you are suffocated within heaps upon heaps of sand only to be spat out onto the ground. You're all not entirely sure of what just happened but now there's a spot in the centre of the sky that appears to be funnelling down sand. Perhaps that was just some weird hallucination, though you are quite sure you're hurt a little after being thrown about so violently by the sand like that. 

Contemplating your sanity prevents you from immediately noticing a robed figure that approaches each of you from behind. You hear them clear their throat which snaps you out of your thoughts immediately, whisking yourself in a 180 degree motion to face them with your guard up. They say nothing to you for a moment before gently extending a hand out towards you, as if to ask for your hand in theirs. 

**Do you accept their hand?** *If they don't then the figure reaches out and grabs onto their hand*
Their hand firms its grip on yours before pulling you closer, exposing your inner forearm. With their other hand, they reveal a glowing, crimson branding stick. Before you're able to react the hot brand is pressed firmly against your arm and all you can do is let out a horrific scream of agony. The burning ache sends your entire body into shock and all of you pass out. 

### Welcome to Purgatory
Everything is silent. You are now in a void of absolute darkness, it is cold and you've never felt so alone. Then, there is a voice .... **Mokat speaks**

The players meet [[Mokat Irai the Necromancer|Mokat]]

### The River
As all of you wait by the dock for the Ferryman you notice a pale flickering light glistening through the thick fog. Gently, the creaking gondola begins to push its way past the curtains of fog slowly pulling up to the dock so that each of you may hop on board. 

**Do any of you look at the figure?** [[The Ferryman]] 
**Do you hop on board immediately or attempt to communicate with the ferryman?** He will stop you and ask for something of value but will then suggest that you may simply pay with a debt to him, a debt that he may call upon in the future.

Once the deal has been made, the Ferryman skillfully pushes the gondola away from the dock using his staff and you begin your journey northward. The water is murky though it's hard to really see with this thick fog surrounding you. The lantern at the front of the gondola can only do so much. As the quiet rowing starts to calm each of you down from the rude awakening you've had so far you start to hear soft thudding sounds against the base of the boat.

**Do you inspect?** Upon a closer look to see past the boat's glass frame you begin to recognise what you believe are hundreds upon hundreds of hands weakly attempting to grasp onto the bottom of the boat. Occasionally the boat rocks at the force but the ferryman seems unbothered by this.

**Do you chose to sit still or investigate further?**
- If they touch the water -> DC 15 Strength Save or begin to be dragged into the water
- If they fail -> Life is drained from them and only the husk of their body remains

The journey is long or perhaps it just felt long since you spent it in the company of all the unsettling things stirring within the water. Once all of you hop off, the ferryman gestures goodbye and disappears within the fog once again. Up ahead looks to be some sort of old town.

**Whoever has the amulet** -> You can hear Moks voice in your head telling you to head on up the hill and towards the church, that is where we'll be able to meet with someone who might be able to resolve the party's issue.

### The Rising Figure
As all of you walk away towards the city and out of reach. Unbeknown to you, the murky water begins to bubble and out comes a dark shadow with piercing white eyes. The form it takes is indiscernible. The being begins to slowly trudge along to the trail left by your footprints. 

**Note:** None of you see this!

### Waiting Room Hellscape
- People waiting in pews
- [[The Ferryman]] is stood at the alter facing the people, they read out a number and you watch as an elderly woman rises from one of the frontmost pews, and walks to the large stained glass window behind the altar. As she presses a wrinkled hand to it the image in the glass morphs to a swamp bathed in red, weeping figure buried in the bloody earth. Before she can react shes absorbed into the glass and it returns to it previous form.
