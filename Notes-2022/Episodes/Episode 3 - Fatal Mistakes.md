# RECAP
Last week our adventurers managed to con their way into the Watcher's Camp. We watched them flex their battle skills in front of the mighty Lieutenant Firestar before heading off on a tour of the site. Unfortunately, unbeknown to them the drafted have a rather keen sense of smell that no amount of "anti-life" perfume could begin to mask. After being tossed into a jail and receiving a few flashbacks of the past our brave group met with a dead god. Sealing a deal to restore Thatcher to his former glory with a single pinky promise they were freed from their cell and forced into a battle of wits and strength to reach the bridge to Necropolis.

Now in the dead of the night, they run scattered through the streets of the city, fleeing the thundering footsteps of Firestar who is hot on their trail. Will the shadow lurking in the corners of their eyes finally reveal itself to be an ally? or will the decision to run into this shabby little tavern prove to be fatal?

# Gunners Tavern - The Stinky Seagull
## Hiding from Firestar
*GM Note: Gunner is in the front of the tavern cleaning, Mallory is in the basement and clay is snoozing in the rafters*

```PLAY ARTIST'S GARRET```
Due to the sheer speed at which all of you have been fleeing, each of you, one by one, come barrelling in to the tavern before collapsing onto the hard wood floors. It is quiet except for the noise of your heavy breathing for a moment as you get your bearings. As you glance upwards to get a feel for the room you all lock eyes with this towering figure before you. He appears to be a stocky, older man with a rough beard. He looks over at each of you before gesturing behind him -- pointing towards the back of the bar. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you attempt to hide over there? Are you trying to speak with this man? Do you try to hide anywhere else?
> 
> Please make a stealth check.

**PLACE DESCRIPTION:**
The tavern is small and empty, clearly not a popular breakfast spot, but cosy nonetheless. There is a wooden sign, barely hanging on to a nail on the wall that reads "The Stinky Seagull Tavern". You do recognise that you don't have long to take it all in though, fully aware of Firestars relentless approach.

**Give them a minute in real time to figure out what to do - set a actual timer?

After what feels like a century, and also a moment, the door slams open and all of your hear Firestars heavy footsteps walking in. 

**Gunner covers for them - might give firestar a chance to snoop / come close - but stop him
If the try to confront Firestar, clay and gunner will jump in to help so they have less of a chance of dying

----

## Next Steps + Long rest
Upon Firestar's departure, the mood of the room lightens significantly and this older man signals to the rest of you that you're free to come out of hiding as he makes his way back behind the bar. In a split second a seagull appears suddenly from out of nowhere and gently sits on the man's shoulder. 

**GUNNER:** "Clay, please go fetch Mallory so she can come help fix these folks up ... "

The seagull nods and flies past the rest of you and out through the backdoor. Not a moment later it reappears, buried all cozy in the curly hair of a woman dressed in a doctor's coat and slippers. 

**Cue for Mallory and Gunner to introduce themselves to the party and begin the whole fixing up process**

As each of you gets the medical attention that you so desperately need after the aftermath of the watcher's camp chaos, you're all able to take a much quicker than normal long rest. Despite her chaotic appearance, she's definitely the finest medical professional you've ever met.

Once all of you are patched up, Gunner beckons for you to come sit by the bar as he pours each of you a drink. Jo, you sense the trinket hanging around your neck begin to rock side to side gently and with a quick puff of green smoke you watch as Mok frees himself from the confines of the trinket and sits himself right next to the rest of yall. 

He looks exhausted -- you all wonder if holding his form in that tiny, confined space forces him to expend a lot of magical energy. Faye, you notice from the corner of your eye that Gunner's face hardens a little bit, perhaps because of how yall have just sprung up another surprise guest into his space ...

Mok grabs hold of your glass (some player's glass) and downs it all in one quick chug. He slams the glass back down onto the counter top and sighs to himself. 

**MOK:** "We're almost there ... we just need to get to the garden gates and I know someone in this city that'll take us right to it ... 
			Except ... to speak with them we first need to get access into their club, the Saxa-bone... " 

You notice Mallory and Gunner both look over at each other and then back at the rest of you.

**GUNNER should question them as to why they're trying to speak with 'The Lady of Saxabone'**

Gunner sighs softly to himself.

**GUNNER:** "You'll need to know what the secret password is and it changes every week. To get in they usually send you an invite with the code, that's how I got in three weeks ago as a performer ..."

You all watch as gunner slams his palm down on the table twice to make a thud sound. He then knocks once and slams his palm down again. 
Gunner then gestures over to his seagull.

**GUNNER:** "Clay was invited there last week to talk about his new book about mushrooms -- show them your code son"

The seagull swoops down onto the counter and gently taps it with his claws open, knocks on it with his claws bunched up once followed by two more open clawed taps. 

Mallory chimes in as well

**MALLORY:** "I had been called in for an emergency there two weeks ago and this is the code they sent me ..."

Mallory slams her palm down on the table twice followed by two knocks.

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Let them figure out the puzzle itself -- the solution is one palm slam, one knock, one palm slam and another knock

## Journey through Necropolis
```PLAY MEDIEVAL TOWN```
Once all of you are satisfied that you've cracked the code, Gunner will draw out a map of the city for you to make navigating to the Saxabone a lot easier. As you're sent off back on your journey, Mallory, Gunner and Clay both watch from the tavern doorway. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do any of you look back? 
> For those that do: You see that shadow with the glowing eyes stood beside Gunner and when you blink again it is gone ... 

As you journey onwards through the city you do take a moment to appreciate the sheer beauty of this city of the dead. Its allure is matched by the backdrop of everclear skies and the rich, luscious farmland fields. Gunner's map takes you down through some winding alleyways and finally you are faced with a door down a quiet, dimly lit alley. The soft soothing sound of jazz seems to permeate past the barrier and flow out into the corridor. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>What do you do?
>Upon a successful knock -- There is a click and the door creaks open and the jazz music gets a little louder, stood in front of you is a skeleton in a luxurious velvet maroon suit. It looks each of you up and down, nods and gestures for you to follow it in.

## The Saxabone Bar
```PLAY COTTON CLUB```
The Saxabone Bar is a rather lively place for something located in the middle of Necropolis. The music here is accompanied by the charming voices of a couple of singers up on stage who seem to be entertaining a small crowd of drunken guests as they stumble about on the dance floor. All around the ground floor are numerous game tables where dice, cards and coins seem to be flung about with little hesitation. 

You hear the jeers of victory and the cries of loss echo throughout the venue. At one of the tables you see a gentleman with an alligator head hollering drunkenly at one of the skeleton waiters for more alcohol. Opposite him at another table, you watch a group of players chatter away with two skeletons, one in a party hat and another with what you're quite sure are cat ears ...  

Tucked away in a corner is a guarded staircase. You assume beyond this point is where the Lady of the bar lies. There are two skeletons here guarding the doorway and they seem to be turning away anyone that walks up to them. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>If they attempt to interact with the guards to go upstairs they'll just get turned away without another word.
>
>Perhaps they can ask around and see how one can get past the barrier? 
>Speak to Florida Man - Mr. Florida who'll tell them that only by winning impressive amounts of money on the game floor can you get VIP access to speak with the Lady.
>
>If they end up playing like shite then Florida man will thank them for their company and assist them in causing enough chaos so that they can sneak past the guards up the stairs.

**For when they need that distraction after playing like shit:**
Florida man will sigh to himself and put his glass down, thanking all of you for your company this evening despite your terrible gambling skills. He'll then glance over to the staircase and its guards before turning back to wink at all of you. You all then watch as Florida man picks up one of the chairs and then smashes it atop the head of one of the skeleton dealers, who is scarily completely un-phased by the impact it seems. The guards stood in the corners of the venue all rush over to apprehend Mr. Florida has he begins his rampage about the venue. Glasses of gin go flying across the room as folks scramble to loot the coins that get tossed into the air. 

The path to the lady now sits unguarded as all of the guards are a little preoccupied with your new found friend's interesting attempt at a distraction.

## The Lady of Saxabone
Sneaking your way quietly up these creaky stairs you all finally reach the top floor. It's a rather dark room which looks to be the office of the Lady's operations. It's currently empty, or so you think ... before you hear the quiet scattering come from behind you and then above you. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> What are you doing?

In front of you stands a rather intimidating arachnid-like figure. The hairs at the back of your necks stand at attention as you feel the gaze of several eyes lock onto each you. She calls out to all of you as she seats herself down on her arm chair, gesturing at the seats before you. Her voice is alluring ... 

**The LADY:** "You really are a cunning group of adventurers ... great choice of distraction .. Mr. Florida loves a good bar fight"

She leans back into her chair, reaching for her smoking pipe. She looks over to you Faye, and smiles softly ..

**The LADY:** "Would you be so kind?" 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Do you help her light it?
>If not she chuckles to herself and snaps her fingers, immediately you see a soft glow emanate from the base of the pipe and puffs of smoke start to appear. 

**The LADY:** "So what can I help you lovely folks with? We're all out of silk at the moment I'm afraid... the most recent shipment is heading off to Death's garden later this evening ... so if that's what you're here for I'm afraid you'll have to wait a few days."

She leans in to take another swift inhale from the smoking pipe but as soon as she hears you mention Mok's name she freezes. Her eyes slowly turning to look at all of you and she gently puts the pipe down. 

**The LADY:** "Mok sent you? Hah ... of course he did ... I'm surprised he's still around. He used to be one of the best gamblers out here I tell yah!"

She pauses, looking away for a second and exhaling a heavy breath. 

**The LADY:** " and a good friend ... or something like that ..."

"I can sneak you into the Garden via the shipment today but what happens beyond that is beyond me I'm afraid ... will that be alright? We usually drop the cart of silk off by the garden and it gets picked up by one of the guards. I'll arrange for my delivery guy to take care of that guard ... " 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you agree to this offer?
> Once players agree we head on to the next bit -- give them the opportunity to sorta ask some questions

## The Garden
```PLAY SHAMANS HOLLOW```
Once you're all piled up underneath the bags full of silk your journey continues on towards the Garden. The ride is a mildly bumpy one as the Lady did warn the driver to be extra careful with this shipment. It takes about an hour or so of being jostled about before the cart comes to a halt. Then there are three taps by the side followed by absolute silence. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Do any of you peek out beyond the bags of goods?

Looking out you see a magnificently lush, green garden with an assortment of flora growing from every corner. There is a big metallic gate up ahead. Peering out a little more you see can't seem to see anyone else. You notice on the floor the remnants of a teleportation spell, it seems the driver has dropped the shipment off and headed back. You assume he also dealt with the guard as there's a tiny bit of ash by the teleportation circle. Thus, leaving just the four of you plus Mok and this cart of silk. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you get out and checkout the gate or stay still?

The gate towers over all of you in all its large, metallic glory. There seems to be a tiny bit of wording engraved onto the stone wall it's connected to and it reads ...

"The key is found within you, use this key to paint me red, be aware of what you spurn, for what you give shall be returned".

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> The party must use blood and smear it on the wall (where they get it from is up to them), and a duplicate of what the blood came from emerges out of the wall. The party must fight and defeat the duplicate to unlock the door.

As you smear your bloodied hand across this doorway you watch as your blood marks across the door begin to push outwards, away from the door, splattering onto the ground and a figure starts to take shape. Within a mere few seconds you are all now faced with a clone of (Player name here) -- please roll initiative

## The Weighing ...
```PLAY HIDDEN VALLEY```
As the doors crack open out comes a familiar figure, it's the ferryman except this time they're holding a scale. 

**FERRYMAN:** "Only those of pure intent and soul can set foot beyond this zone. To enter the Crown step forward my brave friend and we'll determine if you are what you think you are. The scale calls for just one."

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Let them determine who it'll be ...

```STOP HIDDEN VALLEY```
```PLAY GATEWAY TO HELL```
(Player name here) as you walk up to the Ferryman, he will ask you to close your eyes and to only reopen them after a single breath passes. Once you reopen, them you feel yourself falling through a sparkling galaxy only to get caught in the giant palm of the ferryman who looms over you like a giant. He gently places you onto one end of the scale. Looking over to the other side you see a bright glowing light.

For the rest of you, you watch as (Player name here) gets warped into a tiny marble ball that looks like a self contained galaxy as the Ferryman gestures dramatically. They then pick up the marble and place it onto the scale. He doesn't appear to place anything else on the other scale plate. 

You all look on with anticipation as the scale plates begin to rock up and down once the marble has been placed. It finally reaches an equilibrium point and you all breathe out an exasperated sigh of relief -- perhaps too soon for suddenly the scale plate with the marble begin's to tip downwards, violently disrupting the symmetry.

In the eyes of (Player name here) you notice a familiar figure clinging on to the edge of your plate, attempting to drag it down with its weight -- the shadow has returned and it's trying to tell you something. Yet every time it attempts to speak the sounds come out like static screeches of agony. 

Now stuck frozen in a shock-fuelled trance, you're blind to the speed at which your side of the scale continues to descend far below the equilibrium you had just achieved ... much to the horror of all your friends who are unaware of your plunge into the darkness of the void...

(Player Name), for a moment the darkness parts like a veil as you stare into its hypnotic eyes and you see a vision of a horned silhouette, crumpling to the floor as they are hit with a blast of searing emerald flames. 

Back on the plate, the figure starts to take shape, becoming a silhouette that is now shockingly familiar. But before it has chance to become clear, the Ferryman's massive hand sweeps in front of you, sending the shadow hurtling into the darkness. 

The plates rise and fall wildly, and with your fate hanging in the balance, that's where we'll end it for today's session.
