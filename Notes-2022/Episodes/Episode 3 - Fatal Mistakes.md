# RECAP
Last week our adventurers managed to con their way into the Watcher's Camp. We watched them flex their battle skills in front of the mighty Lieutenant Firestar before heading off on a tour of the site. Unfortunately, unbeknown to them the drafted have a rather keen sense of smell that no amount of "anti-life" perfume could begin to mask. After being tossed into a jail and receiving a few flashbacks of the past our brave group met with a dead god. Sealing a deal to restore Thatcher to his former glory with a single pinky promise they were freed from their cell and forced into a battle of wits and strength to reach the bridge to Necropolis.

Now in the dead of the night, they run scattered through the streets of the city, fleeing the thundering footsteps of Firestar who is hot on their trail. Will the shadow lurking in the corners of their eyes finally reveal itself to be an ally? or will the decision to run into this empty abandoned tavern prove to be fatal?
