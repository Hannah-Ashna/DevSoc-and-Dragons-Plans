they are initially dead
in a valley of white, endless sand dunes
the ground begins to rumble as a pedastal emerges in the distance. It beckons them closer. You feel compelled towards it.

As you make your way closer you notice a few odd items protruding out of the dunes. 
- A skeletal hand holding on to a pair of sunglasses
- 
Upon the pedestal rests a peculliar sort of inscription. You're unfamiliar with this language.

(consequences of interacting with pedestal????)
(more stuff here)

You notice that the sand has begun to trickle in from the sky and those magnificent boundless dunes are simply an illusion. There is a single, circular wall that surrounds you. The sand continues to make its way down this funnel of a sky. 

Make a survival check? 

A) Yeah you realise that if you dont find a way out of here, you're going to suffocate to death once all this sand locks you in.

B) Ah it's sort of a vibe right now, you're not quite sure what's going on but this is one hell of a dream. 


A mystical hand saves them?? to they accept the hand or the beckoning call from behind? Either way they all wake up but if they accepted the hand they will have to recollection of they the fuck they are.

(If all reject the hand as they pull back to the voice, the hand yanks them back and they feel a searing burn on their inner forearm -- as if they were being branded) roll to see if they get away?

Those that don't remember anything are told that they are dying -- unlike the other two that have healed up a fair bit since their knock out by the bbeg. The arm that is branded is started to go black at the finger tips and their arm feels much weaker than the other. 


(Were they rescued by a necromancer? and brought back to life in a risky way that some of them would have to pay for it with their souls? hence the branding?? Is the necromancer the original BBEG?? are they still the BBEG?)
