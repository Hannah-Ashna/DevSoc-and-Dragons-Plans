# RECAP
Last week our adventurers befriended a peculiar bunch at the tavern that they believed was empty. With the help of Gunner they barely managed to escape Firestar's wrath only to then discover that they've lost Patro along the way ... Confused, wounded and exhausted they all spend the night at the Stinky Seagull tavern as they formulate a plan to get into the Saxabone to meet with Mok's friend, The Lady. Upon successfully decoding the password to entry they make their way into the saxabone and get the chance to play all sorts of games in the company of some interesting patrons of the venue. Faye managed to win big that night while Jeremy and Jo watched in awe. One bar fight and a weird discussion later, our party finds themselves at the Garden. With one fell swoop of a bloodied hand they unleash Faye's doppleganger upon them. 

After a nerve wrecking battle the gang watches the gates to Death's home open only to then be stopped by the Ferryman who demands a righteous soul as an offering to the balance. We pick up where we left off now with Jo hanging on for dear life as Faye and Jeremy look on with horror. 

# Resuming Balance
```PLAY GATEWAY TO HELL```
The wild swinging of the scales has you, Jo, scrambling to maintain your footing on your own plate. After watching your shadow friend get swatted into the abyss of nothingness you're quite sure you don't fancy a trip out there too, at least, anytime soon. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Please make a dexterity check:
> - Lower than a 15 : You try your hardest to flow with the plate's movements but for a moment you miss a beat and your foot slips, and now you find yourself in the same position as the shadow, clinging on to the edge by your finger tips. Looking up you see a distorted hand reach out to you ... do you grab it?
> - 15 and above: You're a pro at this, you're in your element Jo, a master of balance and as you get yourself in the zone you feel a hand on your shoulder as it's the shadow again -- somehow having returned from the abyss it has come back to assist you this time in achieving equilibrium. 

As the plates settle, there is a loud ringing sound and the glistening light on the other plate begins to glow even brighter -- the brightness starts to burn a little bit, forcing you to shield your eyes from it. Then, there is silence, followed by the hyperventilating breaths of your companions as they stand, hovering over you nervously. Jo, you are now back in the garden -- laying flat on your back in the comfy grass, free of your marble form.

Jeremy and Faye, both of you witness as those once unstable plates with the marble on it begin to equalise and within a split second the Ferryman and the scales disappear out of sight and the marble seems to have returned Jo to you. The gates into the Crown now lay wide open for you.

# The Crown
```PLAY LUSH WORLD```
The path into the Crown is a winding dirt road. From a glance it appears the influence of the Garden seems to come from within Death's fortress for you're surrounded by the sights of beautiful flowers and trees. The enchanting smell of the place feels homely and calming. Almost like a direct contrast to Purgatory and Jahm-Pasyir where you started your journey. In the distance, you hear a barking dog and and the gentle snips of a hedging tool. Up ahead is a cozy little cottage and right by a hedge, snipping away is a hunched old lady humming to herself as she keeps busy.

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you go up to her? Sneak around?

**DEATH:** "Aiyah! I'm so sorry ah my soldiers can be a little bit difficult -- all this fuss over me as if I don't spend most of my days here working on my garden ...  Ah okay okay you must be sooo tired right? Come come I bring some tea and games for us while we sit in the back garden"

She beckons all of you to follow her ... do you?
At the back of the cottage is a magnificent courtyard complete with fountains, more plants and a cozy seating area. It appears drinks and games are ready.
As you all get nice and comfy, she'll look over at an empty seat before exclaiming to herself

**DEATH:** "Eh .. ah yes there was more of you right?"

```STOP LUSH WORLD```

# Patro POV
```PLAY HEART: ABSOLUTION```
Patro, you awaken with the abrupt and unpleasant sensation of icy cold water being thrown at you. As you pry your eyes open you find yourself bound with rope to a chair in a dimly lit room. Your vision is a little blurry and your head really ... really ... hurts .. the last thing you remember doing is sneaking through the city of Necropolis while fleeing from Firestar before something, or someone landed a pretty heavy blow to your cranium. Despite the foggy vision and dark room you're able to make out two figures in the distance as they have a muffled discussion amongst themselves.

**THE LADY:** "Ah so you've managed to find the runaway? I'm sure you've got your orders from him so make sure you take care of this ... problem ... I've got preparations to make... the day of the resurrection is upon us ..." 

Just as you're about to slowly regain your sight you watch as the talking figure turns to leave as the other moves in a little bit closer. You hear the agonizing screeching of an axe blade dragging across the concrete floor like nails to a chalk board as this malevolent being inches closer towards you. As you begin to pull and tug at your binds you realise it's futile.

Closing your eyes to greet what will perhaps be your actual death you suddenly feel a gentle sea breeze grace your skin. Your hands are free and as you sneak a peek behind your eyelids you see your companions next to you, all a little bit confused for you see, Death had just snapped her fingers and now you've got a dazed Patro seated beside you.
```STOP HEART: ABSOLUTION```

# Back to the Crown
```PLAY LUSH WORLD```

**DEATH:** "There was another but ... tsch .. they're somewhere I cannot reach unfortunately"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give them the opportunity to talk through some stuff with Death here 
> If they ask what the symbols mean or who gave it to them she'll say it wasn't her -- she's not in the habit of marking people
> If they finally ask if she can get them back to their world she'll say:

She gestures at your necklace Jo, 
**DEATH:** "You've always had the answer with you since you've gotten here"

# It's time to go home ...
```PLAY SOLEMN VOW```
The gentle lull of the water calms your anxious nerves as the Ferryman pushes the gondola away from the dock and off into the foggy ocean. He asks that each of you remain seated with your eyes closed, taking your time to pace your breathing as the ride home can be a turbulant one. 

Allowing the sound of waves to harmonically send you into a meditative state each of you finds yourselves floating through a sparkling galaxy. You watch as a giant hourglass, almost at its end is flipped over by a gargantuan hand. Your life has been restored and the memories of who you all once were return to you. You see yourselves being merry in the company of many at a local Snottingham tavern. Flashes of your journey out west show you battling with hordes of undead. Jeremy, you watch yourself uncover hundreds of scrolls full of necromantic spells as Faye reaches over to point out a location on a map. Jo and Patro stand in the back sharpening weapons as a horned figure walks up to the rest of you in the cave holding an assignment scroll. 

In front of you now stands the imposing exterior of Mok's tavern and as you peer in from the outside through the windows you watch a brutal exchange involving magic and blade between yourselves and Mok only to have it end in the horrific deaths of each of you. Patro without a heart, Jo stabbed and hung up on a wall like some sort of ornament, Jeremy shuddering all by himself in a corner attempting to patch himself up as blood continues to spill from his side and Faye currently engulfed in bright green flames. The door to the tavern swings wide open, calling out to each of you to enter ..

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you enter? There is an engraving on the floor right outside the door 

All things are born for me.  
His father and his mother, –yet man hates  
         Me foolishly.  
An easy spirit and a free lives on,  
But he who fears the ice doth stumble.

The four of you all jolt up off the creaky wooden floor feeling like you've just been electrified awake with a fresh breath of life. Patro you instinctively grasp onto your chest, briefly recalling the horrific memory of watching your heart leave you for a moment only to discover that everything seems intact aside from the dried blood stains you're covered in. As each of you slowly makes your way up onto steady footing you notice that you're back where it all began, in Mok's tavern, except this time it's flipped ... a reflection of what his home looked like in the underworld. Beside you there lays a horned figure that lays still on the ground. It doesn't move an inch. As the memories of your life come flooding back in, Jo you recognise this body to be that of your party's tiefling warlock, Valikat. The friend that died protecting you from Mok's necromantic flames. The gentle light of the outside world shimmers in past through the curtains ... you're alive. Gifted with a second chance at life you now get to return home to Snottingham and claim the reward for the defeat of Mokat Irai the cruel Necromancer. 

And that my friends, is where our journey ends ...
