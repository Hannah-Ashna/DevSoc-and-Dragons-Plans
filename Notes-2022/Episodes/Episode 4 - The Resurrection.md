# RECAP
Last week our adventurers befriended a peculiar bunch at the tavern that they believed was empty. With the help of Gunner they barely managed to escape Firestar's wrath only to then discover that they've lost Patro along the way ... Confused, wounded and exhausted they all spend the night at the Stinky Seagull tavern as they formulate a plan to get into the Saxabone to meet with Mok's friend, The Lady. Upon successfully decoding the password to entry they make their way into the saxabone and get the chance to play all sorts of games in the company of some interesting patrons of the venue. Faye managed to win big that night while Jeremy and Jo watched in awe. One bar fight and a weird discussion later, our party finds themselves at the Garden. With one fell swoop of a bloodied hand they unleash Faye's doppleganger upon them. 

After a nerve wrecking battle the gang watches the gates to Death's home open only to then be stopped by the Ferryman who demands a righteous soul as an offering to the balance. We pick up where we left off now with Jo hanging on for dear life as Faye and Jeremy look on with horror. 

# Resuming Balance
```PLAY GATEWAY TO HELL```
The wild swinging of the scales has you, Jo, scrambling to maintain your footing on your own plate. After watching your shadow friend get swatted into the abyss of nothingness you're quite sure you don't fancy a trip out there too, at least, anytime soon. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Please make a dexterity check:
> - Lower than a 15 : You try your hardest to flow with the plate's movements but for a moment you miss a beat and your foot slips, and now you find yourself in the same position as the shadow, clinging on to the edge by your finger tips. Looking up you see a distorted hand reach out to you ... do you grab it?
> - 15 and above: You're a pro at this, you're in your element Jo, a master of balance and as you get yourself in the zone you feel a hand on your shoulder as it's the shadow again -- somehow having returned from the abyss it has come back to assist you this time in achieving equilibrium. 

As the plates settle, there is a loud ringing sound and the glistening light on the other plate begins to glow even brighter -- the brightness starts to burn a little bit, forcing you to shield your eyes from it. Then, there is silence, followed by the hyperventilating breaths of your companions as they stand, hovering over you nervously. Jo, you are now back in the garden -- laying flat on your back in the comfy grass, free of your marble form.

Jeremy and Faye, both of you witness as those once unstable plates with the marble on it begin to equalise and within a split second the Ferryman and the scales disappear out of sight and the marble seems to have returned Jo to you. The gates into the Crown now lay wide open for you.

# The Crown
```PLAY LUSH WORLD```
The path into the Crown is a winding dirt road. From a glance it appears the influence of the Garden seems to come from within Death's fortress for you're surrounded by the sights of beautiful flowers and trees. The enchanting smell of the place feels homely and calming. Almost like a direct contrast to Purgatory and Jahm-Pasyir where you started your journey. In the distance, you hear a barking dog and and the gentle snips of a hedging tool. Up ahead is a cozy little cottage and right by a hedge, snipping away is a hunched old lady humming to herself as she keeps busy.

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you go up to her? Sneak around?

**DEATH:** "Aiyah! I'm so sorry ah my soldiers can be a little bit difficult -- all this fuss over me as if I don't spend most of my days here working on my garden ...  Ah okay okay you must be sooo tired right? Come come I bring some tea  that'll get you patched up and games for us while we sit in the back garden"

She beckons all of you to follow her ... do you?
At the back of the cottage is a magnificent courtyard complete with fountains, more plants and a cozy seating area. It appears drinks and games are ready.
As you all get nice and comfy a crusty white little dog will come hopping over with a stick in its mouth. The old lady will reach over and toss it across the garden and the dog gleefully chases after it. She'll look over at an empty seat before exclaiming to herself

**DEATH:** "Eh .. ah yes there was more of you right?"

```STOP LUSH WORLD```

# Patro POV
```PLAY HEART: ABSOLUTION```
Patro, you awaken with the abrupt and unpleasant sensation of icy cold water being thrown at you. As you pry your eyes open you find yourself bound with rope to a chair in a dimly lit room. Your vision is a little blurry and your head really ... really ... hurts .. the last thing you remember doing is sneaking through the city of Necropolis while fleeing from Firestar before something, or someone landed a pretty heavy blow to your cranium. Despite the foggy vision and dark room you're able to make out two figures in the distance as they have a muffled discussion amongst themselves.

**THE LADY:** "Ah so you've managed to find the runaway? I'm sure you've got your orders from him so make sure you take care of this ... problem ... I've got preparations to make... the day of the resurrection is upon us ..." 

Just as you're about to slowly regain your sight you watch as the talking figure turns to leave as the other moves in a little bit closer. You hear the agonizing screeching of an axe blade dragging across the concrete floor like nails to a chalk board as this malevolent being inches closer towards you. As you begin to pull and tug at your binds you realise it's futile.

Closing your eyes to greet what will perhaps be your actual death you suddenly feel a gentle sea breeze grace your skin. Your hands are free and as you sneak a peek behind your eyelids you see your companions next to you, all a little bit confused for you see, Death had just snapped her fingers and now you've got a dazed Patro seated beside you.
```STOP HEART: ABSOLUTION```

# Back to the Crown
```PLAY LUSH WORLD```

**DEATH:** "There was another but ... tsch .. they're somewhere I cannot reach unfortunately"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give them the opportunity to talk through some stuff with Death here
> If they drink the tea they'll get the equivalent of a long rest
> If they ask what the symbols mean or who gave it to them she'll say it wasn't her -- she's not in the habit of marking people
> If they finally ask if she can get them back to their world she'll say:

She gestures at your necklace Jo, 
**DEATH:** "You've always had the answer with you since you've gotten here"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give them some time to bicker amongst themselves or attempt to decode it
> 
> Eventually as you're all discussing this new found information amongst yourselves, the trinket hanging around Jo's neck begins to emanate dark green fumes of smoke as Mok makes an appearance behind Jo's chair. 

**MOK:** "Stop with the lyin' all they want to do is go HOME and you're manipulating them just like you manipulated me!"

**DEATH:** "Mokat Irai, you haven't changed a bit since we last spoke -- I warned you to stop playing God and yet here you are again"

_Maybe more bickering here?_

**MOK:** "Enough talking! We end this now ..."

Mok will look over the rest of you sternly as he pushes the palms of his hands together. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> What are you doing? Do you help Mok or have your loyalties swayed? It's time to make a decision for your time is running out ...

**ROLL FOR INITIATIVE**
A ball of bright green energy begins to form around him -- he gently pulls his hands apart and a fiery hot lighting bolt starts to take shape in his hands as he uses it to strike Death down once and for all.  

```STOP LUSH WORLD```


# The Showdown - Mok's Side
```PLAY TERROR IN THE WOODS```
This is the fight against Death and Cerberus - which won't be super hard

Death, despite being restrained to the floor by shadowy tendrils immediately whistles and calls out "CERBERUS! ATTACK!" and the rest of you watch as out from the corner of the cottage comes bounding towards all of you that crusty little white dog you saw earlier ... except as it makes its way closer you look on with horror as its body begins to morph into a muscular, towering three headed beast. It's practically foaming at the mouth from excitement -- the earth quaking beneath its feet as it tramples across the beautifully laid out garden. It runs head first into Mok, knocking him off balance and pushing him away from the rest of you. 

As they fight they will regain their memories seeing MOKs green magic:
* As you watch Mok make his ferocious attacks against Death, for a brief moment you are paralyzed with fear as your body seems to instinctively recognise something that you don't. Mok's never hurt you before but for some reason you're acutely aware of how painful those attacks he so flawlessly dishes out at Death can be ...
* Mok's calculated violence seems to be leaving behind embers of his green flames floating about in the air. Some land on the grassy fields and briefly catch fire. 
* Jeremy as you look on at the unfolding chaos there is a sinking feeling in your gut -- a de ja vu moment almost as if you're reliving some sort of nightmare.

## Mok tries to get the final blow
Just as you're about to make the final blow against Death Mok will scream out to you to ***STOP!*** 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you listen? or is the momentum of your movement far too powerful for you to hold it back now?
> 
> Mok will do everything they can to get the final blow against death


### Mok's Final Blow
You all look on as Mok unleashes the fury of a thousand hell hounds as fiery bolts of lightning crash into Death like a never ending force and then there is silence. All that remains of Death is her glasses atop a pile of ash. 

```STOP TERROR IN THE WOODS``` 
(BREAK) 
```PLAY MIND FLAYER CHAMBER``` 
Stood between yourselves and the now incinerated Death is a heaving Mok that hasn't turned to face you yet. He softly chuckles to himself before leaning back and straightening his shoulders. With one hand he fixes his stetson before whisking himself around to lock eyes with the rest of you. There is an unsettling glint of darkness in his eyes now 

**MOK:** "For a group of fools you've been the best set of puppets a Necromancer could ever ask for ... such a shame I'll have to dispose of you myself now. We can't have you ruining the resurrection day now can we?" 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give them the chance to speak to Mok before engaging in all out warfare against Mok

### Someone's Final Blow
**BETRAYAL ENDING:** One of them becomes death with mok alive - mok will try and trick them that he will sacrifice himself so they can return - then double cross

As you watch Death's lifeless body come crashing down against the soft, grassy floor you watch as her body turns to ash, leaving just her glasses as the wind whisks the rest of her away. Your hands begin to shake a little as you feel the surging energy of some new found power begin to course through your veins. 

```STOP TERROR IN THE WOODS``` 
(BREAK) 
```PLAY MIND FLAYER CHAMBER``` 
For a split second you watch as Mok's glare of anger at you is swapped out for a softer, more comforting look.

**MOK:** "ah! Great work (Player name here) -- it seems you are now Death, ruler of the underworld..." 

Mok briefly sighs to himself

**MOK:** "Shame really, as now you'll never get to return home ... but I can help if you'd like? I'm willing to sacrifice myself to take on the role so that you may return home!"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you accept his offer? Yes? No? 
> 
> Yes - Mok without missing a beat grabs onto your hands and begins to chant out loud to himself, you feel yourself grow weaker as his grip onto your hands tightens. For a second there you recognise this grip on you -- almost like you've been through this before ... As you collapse before him Mok now cackles to himself. 
> 
> **MOK:** "For a group of fools you've been the best set of puppets a Necromancer could ever ask for ... such a shame I'll have to dispose of you myself now. We can't have you ruining the resurrection day now can we?" 
> 
> No - Mok's warm smile fades as he braces himself to strike you down with a bolt of lightning just as he did with Death. He grins menacingly at you as he calls out ...
> 
> **MOK:** "I've worked too damn hard to get here for you imbeciles to ruin the day of the resurrection so I guess I'll just have to kill you MYSELF"

**POTENTIAL BAD ENDING:** If they lose to mok / die again - they go to the place the shadow person is
**POTENTIAL WEIRD ENDING:** If Mok beats death and they fight mok and win - one of them is now death - the ferryman will try and claim the title - esp if it is jeremy and then help send them back home

# The Showdown - Death's Side
```PLAY MIND FLAYER CHAMBER``` 
If they fight mok from the start the Ferryman will jump in to help
**POTENTIAL GOOD ENDING:** They beat Mok and Death sends them back

Death will attempt to shield the rest of you with herself before asking that the rest of you keep your guard up. You watch as she closes her eyes, taking in a slow inhale of breath before her eyes snap wide open and a powerful force field rocks the earth you stand upon shoving Mok backwards a few feet away from you. The sheer force of the attack has Mok coughing up blood but he isn't so easily shaken as he steadies himself, cackling out loud ...

**MOK:** "I have waited ... so very long for this ... and I won't let you or these fools be the ones who put me down"

*Cue the battle stuff*

**Ferryman appears if Mok is struggling/too easy fight** - Out from the corner of your eye you watch as the air begins to warp to create a portal and you watch as the Ferryman steps out, wielding his obsidian glass staff. (Calls for Jeremy's death only when Jeremy attacks him - asks for immunity)

# It's time to go DEAD
As the darkness begins to crawl in from your peripheral vision you feel your breath become laboured. You're exhausted and it's cold. The clashing of swords and spells seems to sound like it's miles away. The blood gushing out of your side feels all too familiar, you can't believe you let Mok get to you twice. As the light leaves your eyes and you're sent to a realm of darkness and absolute silence you hear a familiar voice call on out to you. It's Valikat ... the warlock of your party ... the shadow figure that's been desperately trying to reach out to all of you. They extend a hand out to you and gently rest you down amongst the others at a table within some sort of tavern. You're warm, cozy and most importantly, not bleeding out. Perhaps this whole Death thing isn't too bad.

# It's time to go home ... (Return to the living)
```STOP MIND FLAYER CHAMBER``` 
```PLAY SOLEMN VOW```
**FERRYMAN ENDING:** The gentle lull of the water calms your anxious nerves as the Ferryman pushes the gondola away from the dock and off into the foggy ocean. He asks that each of you remain seated with your eyes closed, taking your time to pace your breathing as the ride home can be a turbulant one. Allowing the sound of waves to harmonically send you into a meditative state each of you finds yourselves floating through a sparkling galaxy. 

**DEATH ENDING:** She'll ask for each of you to to rest flat with your backs against the ground and to look up into the late afternoon sky. As the sound of the waves crashing up against the edge of the island echo through your minds you're simply transfixed by the movement of the clouds up above, unable to take your eyes away from it. You watch as the daylight quickly shifts into night and now you all are staring off into a sparkling galaxy as you feel your bodies now effortlessly begin to float in a starry abyss. You are no longer on the island for you seem to have entered some mystical new realm of nothingness. 

----
You watch as a giant hourglass that fizzles into existence, almost at its end is flipped over by a gargantuan hand. Your life has been restored and the memories of who you all once were return to you. You see yourselves being merry in the company of many at a local Snottingham tavern. Flashes of your journey out west show you battling with hordes of undead. Jeremy, you watch yourself uncover hundreds of scrolls full of necromantic spells as Faye reaches over to point out a location on a map. Jo and Patro stand in the back sharpening weapons as a horned figure walks up to the rest of you in the cave holding an assignment scroll. 

In front of you now stands the imposing exterior of Mok's tavern and as you peer in from the outside through the windows you watch a brutal exchange involving magic and blade between yourselves and Mok only to have it end in the horrific deaths of each of you. Patro without a heart, Jo stabbed and hung up on a wall like some sort of ornament, Jeremy shuddering all by himself in a corner attempting to patch himself up as blood continues to spill from his side and Faye currently engulfed in bright green flames. The door to the tavern swings wide open, calling out to each of you to enter ..

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you enter? There is an engraving on the floor right outside the door 

All things are born for me.  
His father and his mother, –yet man hates  
         Me foolishly.  
An easy spirit and a free lives on,  
But he who fears the ice doth stumble.

The four of you all jolt up off the creaky wooden floor feeling like you've just been electrified awake with a fresh breath of life. Patro you instinctively grasp onto your chest, briefly recalling the horrific memory of watching your heart leave you for a moment only to discover that everything seems intact aside from the dried blood stains you're covered in. As each of you slowly makes your way up onto steady footing you notice that you're back where it all began, in Mok's tavern, except this time it's flipped ... a reflection of what his home looked like in the underworld. Beside you there lays a horned figure that lays still on the ground. It doesn't move an inch. As the memories of your life come flooding back in, Jo you recognise this body to be that of your party's tiefling warlock, Valikat. The friend that died protecting you from Mok's necromantic flames. The gentle light of the outside world shimmers in past through the curtains ... you're alive. Gifted with a second chance at life you now get to return home to Snottingham and claim the reward for the defeat of Mokat Irai the cruel Necromancer. 

And that my friends, is where our journey ends ...
