stuff for next planning: something is pulling the thingy down -- it's the shadow -- trying to stop them from letting mok into the Crown.

Deaths Garden
- Allow them to take a rest
- Enter deaths garden - Mok warns them that death will try and play mind games and not to trust them
Meeting Death
- Meet death - she's outside trimming flowers - she invites them round the back for tea
- death will be like "oh there were more of you" and bring back Patro (Maybe jump over to patro pov briefly as he's magic'd away from wherever), and then say something like "there was another but they're somewhere I cannot reach unfortunately"
- When they ask her about how to return to life she tells them they've had the answer with them entire time and gesture to moks necklace
- Mok will bamf out of the necklace and kick up a fuss saying she's trying to turn them against eachother and initiate a fight 

Fight
- As they fight they will regain their memories seeing MOKs green magic
- F 1 - On moks side against death
	- Death and Cerberus - which won't be super hard
	- Mok will do everything they can to get the final blow against death
- F 2 - On deaths side against Mok
	- If they fight mok from the start the Ferryman will jump in to help
- F 3 - Mok beats death and becomes death
	- big fight against Mok - who is now death


Outcomes
- Good Ending: They beat Mok and Death sends them back
- Bad Ending: They lose to mok / die again - they go to the place the shadow person is
- Betrayal Ending: One of them becomes death with mok alive - mok will try and trick them that he will sacrifice himself so they can return - then double cross
- Weird Ending: Mok beats death and they fight mok and win - one of them is now death - the ferryman will try and claim the title - esp if it is jeremy
