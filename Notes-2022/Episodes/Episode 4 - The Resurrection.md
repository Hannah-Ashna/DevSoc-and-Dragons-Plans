# RECAP
Last week our adventurers befriended a peculiar bunch at the tavern that they believed was empty. With the help of Gunner they barely managed to escape Firestar's wrath only to then discover that they've lost Patro along the way ... Confused, wounded and exhausted they all spend the night at the Stinky Seagull tavern as they formulate a plan to get into the Saxabone to meet with Mok's friend, The Lady. Upon successfully decoding the password to entry they make their way into the saxabone and get the chance to play all sorts of games in the company of some interesting patrons of the venue. Faye managed to win big that night while Jeremy and Jo watched in awe. One bar fight and a weird discussion later, our party finds themselves at the Garden. With one fell swoop of a bloodied hand they unleash Faye's doppleganger upon them. 

After a nerve wrecking battle the gang watches the gates to Death's home open only to then be stopped by the Ferryman who demands a righteous soul as an offering to the balance. We pick up where we left off now with Jo hanging on for dear life as Faye and Jeremy look on with horror. 

# Resuming Balance
The wild swinging of the scales has you, Jo, scrambling to maintain your footing on your own plate. After watching your shadow friend get swatted into the abyss of nothingness you're quite sure you don't fancy a trip out there too, at least, anytime soon. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Please make a dexterity check:
> - Lower than a 15 : You try your hardest to flow with the plate's movements but for a moment you miss a beat and your foot slips, and now you find yourself in the same position as the shadow, clinging on to the edge by your finger tips. Looking up you see a distorted hand reach out to you ... do you grab it?
> - 15 and above: You're a pro at this, you're in your element Jo, a master of balance and as you get yourself in the zone you feel a hand on your shoulder as it's the shadow again -- somehow having returned from the abyss it has come back to assist you this time in achieving equilibrium. 

As the plates settle, there is a loud ringing sound and the glistening light on the other plate begins to glow even brighter -- the brightness starts to burn a little bit, forcing you to shield your eyes from it. Then, there is silence, followed by the hyperventilating breaths of your companions as they stand, hovering over you nervously. Jo, you are now back in the garden -- laying flat on your back in the comfy grass, free of your marble form.

Jeremy and Faye, both of you witness as those once unstable plates with the marble on it begin to equalise and within a split second the Ferryman and the scales disappear out of sight and the marble seems to have returned Jo to you. The gates into the Crown now lay wide open for you.

# The Crown
The path into the Crown is a winding dirt road. From a glance it appears the influence of the Garden seems to come from within Death's fortress for you're surrounded by the sights of beautiful flowers and trees. The enchanting smell of the place feels homely and calming. Almost like a direct contrast to Purgatory and Jahm-Pasyir where you started your journey. In the distance, you hear a barking dog and and the gentle snips of a hedging tool. Up ahead is a cozy little cottage and right by a hedge, snipping away is a hunched old lady humming to herself as she keeps busy.

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Do you go up to her? Sneak around?

**DEATH:** "Aiyah! I'm so sorry ah my soldiers can be a little bit difficult -- all this fuss over me as if I don't spend most of my days here working on my garden ...  Ah okay okay you must be sooo tired right? Come come I bring some tea and games for us while we sit in the back garden"

She beckons all of you to follow her ... do you?
At the back of the cottage is a magnificent courtyard complete with fountains, more plants and a cozy seating area. It appears drinks and games are ready.
As you all get nice and comfy, she'll look over at an empty seat before exclaiming to herself

**DEATH:** "Eh .. ah yes there was more of you right?"

# Patro POV
Patro, you awaken by the abrupt and unpleasant sensation of icy cold water being thrown at you. 


She snaps her fingers and right beside you now sits a very confused Patro.

**DEATH:** "There was another but ... tsch .. they're somewhere I cannot reach unfortunately"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give them the opportunity to talk through some stuff with Death here 
> If they ask what the symbols mean or who gave it to them she'll say it wasn't her -- she's not in the habit of marking people
> If they finally ask if she can get them back to their world she'll say:

She gestures at your necklace Jo, 
**DEATH:** "You've always had the answer with you since you've gotten here"
