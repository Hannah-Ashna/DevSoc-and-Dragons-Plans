### All things return to Tavern
Last week we left our brave adventurers in the company of [[Mokat Irai the Necromancer|Mok]], the Harengon as he freed himself of his trinket form and conjured up a little safe space for our party outside the gates of the Watcher's Camp to have a nice little short rest. The manager, AKA a brain in a jar mentioned that each of you died during battle and thus are now being enlisted as new recruits for deaths army. With your new uniforms in hand and your lives on the line -- perhaps it's time to suit up for your next mission. Though ... you can't help but linger on the thought of how you came to be here. Unfortunately, for each of you your memory is foggier than the ocean you crossed to get here. The furthest thing in your memory that you can recall is a pedestal out in a white desert. 

Morning in the underworld feels surprisingly pleasant as the warm rays of light come shining through the windows of Mok's little portable tavern. Each of you is woken up from your little nap with the comforting smell of a hot breakfast. Mok seems to be busy in the kitchen, cooking up something that smells rather good. All of your stomachs growl simultaneously, forming a cacophony of sounds which startles Mok.

**MOK:** "Ah .. I see you're all awake ... hopefully a little bit better rested after all that dungeon crawling you've had to do ..." 

Mok serves you each a nice warm bowl of .... uh .... _something???_ it looks like food but you're not entirely sure what this slop is meant to be. 
It smells delicious though ... 

>**PLAYER ACTION:** 
>Do you try the food? (If yes it heals them up completely) 
>If they ask what's in it just list off a bunch of really weird items
>If they ask what it's called just call it something absurd

As each of you scoffs down your meal, Jeremy you notice Mok's face turn a little solemn as he looks over at each of your arms. 

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Roll an insight check to see whether you can figure out why? (Anything above a 10 succeeds)
>You get the feeling that he feels sorry for all of you ... you can't tell whether this means you all might not make it back to the land of the living ...
>Rolls - 19 or 20 - His mind seems to be running on overdrive, perhaps formulating a plan for what to do next and how to get each of you past this camp ...

Mok finally speaks up ...
**MOK:** "We're running out of time ... and quickly" 

He says this while gesturing at your arms -- you notice that about almost a third of the sand in the hourglass has fallen to the base ...

**MOK:** "Fortunately, since you're all now marked as 'dead' within the system you might be able to smooth talk your way through this camp. However, to my knowledge Death's best generals occupy this area"

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Just an opportunity for players to ask questions if needed or derail probably

**MOK:** "Anyway ... focusing on the mission at hand, there is only one exit when you enter the Watcher's camp. It will lead you into Necropolis, the city of the underworld. This is where the gateway to Death's personal fortress is.

You'll need to get through your base training to earn your passes that'll give you free travel across this land. Death's soldiers tend to roam about these days ..."
