# All things return to Tavern
```PLAY ARTIST'S GARRET```
Last week we left our brave adventurers in the company of [[Mokat Irai the Necromancer|Mok]], the Harengon as he freed himself of his trinket form and conjured up a little safe space for our party outside the gates of the Watcher's Camp to have a nice little short rest. The manager, AKA a brain in a jar mentioned that each of you died during battle and thus are now being enlisted as new recruits for deaths army. With your new uniforms in hand and your lives on the line -- perhaps it's time to suit up for your next mission. Though ... you can't help but linger on the thought of how you came to be here. Unfortunately, for each of you your memory is foggier than the ocean you crossed to get here. The furthest thing in your memory that you can recall is a pedestal out in a white desert. 

Morning in the underworld feels surprisingly pleasant as the warm rays of light come shining through the windows of Mok's little portable tavern. Each of you is woken up from your little nap with the comforting smell of a hot breakfast. Mok seems to be busy in the kitchen, cooking up something that smells rather good. All of your stomachs growl simultaneously, forming a cacophony of sounds which startles Mok.

**MOK:** "Ah .. I see you're all awake ... hopefully a little bit better rested after all that dungeon crawling you've had to do ..." 

Mok serves you each a nice warm bowl of .... uh .... _something???_ it looks like food but you're not entirely sure what this slop is meant to be. 
It smells delicious though ... 

>**PLAYER ACTION:** 
>Do you try the food? (If yes it heals them up by 1d10) 
>If they ask what's in it just list off a bunch of really weird items
>If they ask what it's called just call it something absurd

As each of you scoffs down your meal, Jeremy you notice Mok's face turn a little solemn as he looks over at each of your arms. 

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Roll an insight check to see whether you can figure out why? (Anything above a 10 succeeds)
>You get the feeling that he feels sorry for all of you ... you can't tell whether this means you all might not make it back to the land of the living ...
>Rolls - 19 or 20 - His mind seems to be running on overdrive, perhaps formulating a plan for what to do next and how to get each of you past this camp ...

Mok finally speaks up ...
**MOK:** "We're running out of time ... and quickly" 

He says this while gesturing at your arms -- you notice that about almost a third of the sand in the hourglass has fallen to the base ...

**MOK:** "Fortunately, since you're all now marked as 'dead' within the system you might be able to smooth talk your way through this camp. However, to my knowledge Death's best generals occupy this area"

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Just an opportunity for players to ask questions if needed or derail probably

**MOK:** "Anyway ... focusing on the mission at hand, there is only one exit when you enter the Watcher's camp. It will lead you into Necropolis, the city of the underworld. This is where the gateway to Death's personal fortress is.

You'll need to get through your base training to earn your passes that'll give you free travel across this land. Death's soldiers tend to roam about these days ..."

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Maybe some more discussion on the dumb shit they'll wanna do before arriving
> Do they put on their uniforms?
> MOK gives them a perfume to mask their scent of the living - smells of damp soot.

# Watchers Camp
```PLAY CLASH OF KINGS```
Upon exiting Mok's cozy tavern and basking underneath the sunlight of the underworld, you all watch as Mok gestures grandly and the tavern fizzles out of existence. Mok then assumes the form of the trinket around Jo's neck. Up ahead, is your next challenge, getting past the tight security to get to the gate that leads to Necropolis. 

As you all make your way up towards the fortress you cross over a small stream using a rickety old bridge. In front of the fortress stands two satyr guards. Each of them gives you all a quick glance and then a cheeky grin at each other before one yells out loud.

**GUARD 1:** "HALT! This area is restricted access ... though from the looks of yous I think we've got ourselves some fresh MEAT!"

**GUARD 2:** "Ahh been a while since the manager sent us over some new recruits, I wonder if you be capable or not ..."

**GUARD 1:** "One of us always tells the truth, while the other always lies ... you may ask us a single question... pick out the liar and you shall gain entry into the camp. Fail to do so and we'll happily send you to the Sanguine Swamps"

The second guard nods profusely at this.

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
> So what is your question?
> SOLUTION: They're both fuckin liars -- and kinda stupid if they get caught out they should just bicker about who was meant to be the truth teller that time

Just as you're about to meet your fate a commanding voice calls out, followed by the metallic clanks of a suit of armour. In front of you is a 6ft tall Leonin warrior clad in the finest suit of armour you have ever seen. He greets each of you with a gentle smile before turning to the two Satyrs. You all watch as his smile fades into a terrifying scowl. It appears a lecture is about to begin ...

**FIRESTAR:** "Would you PLEASE stop harassing all our new recruits with your ridiculous riddles ... I'm sure my assessment methods are enough to weed out the unworthy and yet here you are wasting my time and Deaths ... perhaps it would do you some good to sit out in those swamps for a day or two on the night shift!"

The two satyrs start to tremble a little as their apologies come pouring out. 

**FIRESTAR:** "Alright enough ... get on with it you two.."

and off they go, leaving the four of you in the company of this Leonin. He sighs to himself before turning back to face all of you.

**FIRESTAR:** "Where are my manners! I am Firestar, Lieutenant Commander of Death's army here in the underworld. I oversee the training of fresh new recruits so we'll have the chance to get to know each other a little better over these next few weeks. Now ... come, come ... we have plenty to do to get you all set up"

He beckons all of you into the camp...

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>  Do you enter with him? Do you say anything else? Ask him anything else?

# The Fight

As you enter the camp you feel the ground tremble as large groups of troops march about the area in unison. The sounds of soldier chanting out loud are mixed together with the clangs of metal clashing against each other in the distance. However, the blaring sounds aren't enough to drown out what you're quite sure is wailing and screaming in the distance. Perhaps it's coming from their infirmary. 

The buildings here feel rather bland, with their wooden rooftops and dirty concrete walls. You suspect these were white at some point but who cares for walls when you have swords to sharpen and foes to behead. 

Firestar leads all of you through an arched doorway and into a magnificent circular courtyard that's open to the skies. It looks to be some sort of minitature arena. He shuts the door behind all of you once you're in and locks it. 
```STOP CLASH OF KINGS```
```PLAY ENDGAME```

**FIRESTAR:** "Forgive me for putting each of you on the spot like this but the manager isn't known for her great taste in warriors ... According to your records you've all died in battle but I'm sure you know that any fool can die a mundane death in battle, it takes a great warrior to do so gloriously

Thus, we'll start our day off with a little bit of an assessment into your capabilities ... I have prepared a worthy opponent for you... _each other_."

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>  I'm gonna need you to ROLL INITIATIVE
>  If players decline to fight, Firestar he will just whoop their azz instead. We can cut this short depending on how long it's looking to take
>  If they fight, Firestar will heal them all up afterwards?

# The Tour
Firestar applauds all of you for your impressive performance, his grin widens and he nods approvingly. 

**FIRESTAR:** "Oh how I wish to have fought alongside you all in battle... Alright let's give you the tour of the place and show you what we do out here"

He will unlock the doorway to the training centre and lead you out into the camp. Your tour comprises of him showing you about the watchers camp alongside a brief lesson into the hierarchy of Death's Army. By the time you finally reach your final stop on the tour you're quite sure you've shaken at least a 100 different hands and met an array of different folks. Your pit stop at the cafeteria was probably the most exciting part of the tour since it came with free cookies. Firestar seems to ramble on about the two main types of soldiers ...

```PLAY SWAMPLANDIA```

**FIRESTAR:** "So you see you all are what we called the recruited, folks who were warriors in life and have elected to continue to be so in death and out here in the Sanguine swamps is where we get the drafted, individuals who were bad in life and thus sent to these swamps and forced to repent. If they are 'ready' we then come out here and pick them up to begin their training. Be warned though, even a day out here can turn you into a mindless zombie ..."

You now all stand before the border between the swamp and the camp. The sound of wailing and shrieking is almost deafening. The swamp land is bathed in bloodied earth and in the distance you notice heads popping up from beneath the ground, covered in red vines. The air here is putrid from the rotting flesh. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> The smell is so overbearing and thus, can each of you please make a con save to see whether you throw up or not? (12 and above they save)

Firestar chuckles softly to himself before freezing and locking eyes with something behind you Faye. You watch as Firestar's gaze slowly moves down to your arm, his eyes widen in disbelief and in a split second you hear the whizzing of a flare ascend into the sky and crackle up above. The booming sound of sirens begin to set off from a the mouth of raven at the top of a totem in the centre of camp. You watch as soldiers in the distance scatter all about to get a closer look. In a matter of minutes you four are now surrounded by soldiers as their blades and spells lock onto you. There is disappointment in Firestar's eyes. His expression is a solemn one.

**FIRESTAR:** "Unfortunately, I think we'll have to cut your training session here a little short ... I've seen that marking before and I'm not stupid. We've had plenty of the likes of yous come around trying to kill Death and I won't let you. Perhaps you can sit out there in the company of the drafted as you contemplate your heinous sin.

Did no one tell you that when you aren't really dead it isn't easy to fake it? I could smell it on you ... that flowery scent of the living ... but I thought it might've been a mistake ... but the drafted don't make mistakes and look at how many you four have woken up ... "

Firestar gestures out behind you and and beyond the armed soldiers keeping you in place, in that bloodied swamp you see dozens upon dozens of zombies crawling towards you.

**FIRESTAR:** "They want what you have ... so I'm sure you'll have a great time fighting them off when we bury each of you in the swamp ground and perhaps if you survive that we'll reconsider your role with us."

As Firestar is just about to continue, you hear another voice clear his throat and the crowd of soldiers parts to make way for an even more impressive figure than Firestar. 

**FIRESTAR:** "Commander Arbuckle! Apologies you see we've had a little incident ..."

The curly brown-haired human man cuts Firestar off and looks over at you Jeremy. He tilts his head inquisitively ...

**ARBUCKLE:** "You wouldn't happen to be a descendant of Vekron ... would you?"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Jeremy, all of a sudden your mind begins to overflow with memories of your family... you're starting to remember who you are a little bit.
> Do you answer his question?
> If he says yes - Arbuckle is lenient and decides to imprison them 
> If he says no - Arbuckle reiterates that he is quite sure Jeremy is and will chose to imprison them instead to live out their remaining days of life.
> 
> Players can make a history check (+14) to figure out who the fuck this guy even is - He is a man of myth, the original warrior to imprison Octogarf beneath Snottingham many moons ago. He has a great appreciation for all those that fought against that horrifying monstrosity and it appears he might have a soft spot for Jeremy if he is indeed who he thinks he is.
> 
> If they choose to fight - go straight to break and set up escaping camp map - have them run into the swamp

As you are all being dragged away to the prison cells of the camp ... 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Could I please get each of your passive perceptions?

Patro, you lock eyes with a shadowy figure in the distance, it's glowing white eyes blind you briefly and then you see flashes of a bright green flames followed by the gruesome image of a boney hand ripping your heart out of your chest and squeezing it into mush. Your sense are overwhelmed and so you collapse in the arms of the guards pulling you along.

For the rest of you, you watch as Patro's eyes roll back into his skull, showing just the whites of his eyes and in a matter of seconds he goes limp. 

```STOP SWAMPLANDIA```

# The Prison
```PLAY CASTLE JAIL```
The four of you have your weapons stripped from you and are dragged to a run down building on the edge of camp. Inside, you are corralled into a cramped cell. You get the sense that they don't often have reason to imprison anyone, based on weeds growing through the cracked stone floor and musky smell of damp. The only light filters in through a small window barred window at the top of the cell.

As the cell door is locked and the guards begin to filter out, Arbuckle turns to you one last time.

**ARBUCKLE:** "I hope you understand, once the time runs out we can talk about you becoming recruited again."

He then leaves, as do the last of the guards, abandoning you in the darkness. 

Its silent for a moment, except the skittering of rats feet on the cobble. But then, in the darkness of the cell, there's movement, as a figure melds out from the darkness and into the pillar of light for you all to see.  [[Thatcher the Rat Catcher]]

**THATCHER:** "Hi! I'm Thatcher, rat catcher and cat snatcher! I snatch the cats who catch the rat cuz rats make for tasty snacks!"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give players a chance to ask questions and will respond;
> 
>IF THEY ASK WHO THATCHER IS:
>After this Players may make a religion or insight check (DC 10) to realize that Thatcher is a dead God

**THATCHER:** "I once was where there were alleys, and cats and rats, and alley cats and alley rats. I had hosts; catchers and snatchers who made many oaths, but now all of us are ... ghosts!"

>IF THEY ASK HOW / WHY HE IS IN THE CELL:

**THATCHER:** "Cats, like rats, are at my will, and the big cat of the camp did not think that was brill. I could leave whenever I want, but he's so much fun to taunt!"

>CUT OFF WITH

**THATCHER:** "Anyways, according to my nosies, you reek of rosies and posies! so if *you* have the chance at returning to the mortal coil, then so do I, boyo! If you pinky swear you'll keep me in your prayer once you're back there, then I can free you from from this square!"

Thatcher holds out his pinky finger in the air expectantly. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give players the chance to take or decline Thatchers offer (Only one needs to)
> If they accept:

You hook your pinky into Thatchers and he grins wildly at you 

**THATCHER**: "Do you swear to give me prayer, and spread my name across the mortal plane?"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Player accepts?

Thatcher's smile widens further still, and a warm light appears where his pinky meets yours - which grows brighter and brighter, the heat of it teetering on uncomfortable before he releases you. Once you pull away you see a golden scar wrapped around your finger like a ring.

**THATCHER:** "I give you time to get you plans in line, just let me know when you want to go!"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Give players chance to plan their next move - show map?

Thatcher then turns to the back wall of the cell and presses his fingers into the grimy stone. After a second, the bricks begin to shift and warp, parting before him to reveal a dark alley with a light at the end. A cat wanders out of the alley and weaves through his ankles.

**Thatcher:** "Go now friends - I look forward to seeing how this ends!"

And with a wave, Thatcher fades back into the darkness.
```STOP CASTLE JAIL```

# Escaping the Camp
```PLAY ESCAPE FROM SHADOW```
The alley is surprisingly long. As you walk through it you hear the scurrying of rats in the dark beneath you, and have to scoot around boxes and trash, before finally re-emerging into the light. Only you find yourselves on the other side of the wall to your cell, the bricks resealing the mouth of the alley in the same way they revealed it before.

*Take them to the map*

**PLAYER ACTION:** 
> Where are you going first? 
> 	- We're going to use soft initiative, so you can say and do what you're doing or where you're going for each round
> 	- If all sneaking as a group they need to make a group stealth check - take median value of all of their stealth checks

#### Deactivating the alarm 
The totem in the centre of camp has 3 levels, the bottom tier has the carved face of a bear, the middle a wolf and the top a raven. At the very base of the totem, a note written in crayon is pinned. The handwriting is childlike, but you're able to make out what it says.

"Quiet comes when the most protective beast sees where it's pack sleeps,
The largest beast sees where it can find a feast,
and the freest beast is finally released"

> Solution: turn the wolf to face the barracks, the bear to face the mess hall and then there will be a click and they can fully remove the raven totem

#### Opening the Gate
At the top of the tower you find a crank and a chain

If they turn it without someone on the other side > as you start to turn it you realize that there's a lot of resistance, and the chain is is only attached to one side of the gate

With someone on the other side > as you both turn the crank, the gate slowly begins to rise, it looks like its going to take some time for the gate to get high enough

The sound of the gate rising is also pretty loud

DC 20 Athletics check to manually lift the gate bottom - which they have to remake each turn or if they get hit

# The Figure & the Cave
As you make your way across the bloodied earth, Jo, you notice from the corner of your eye a shadowy figure gesturing towards a cave in the distance. It's eyes beckon out to you and you're overcome with a sense of comfort and warmth. The cave it's gesturing to is not too far away though you're not quite sure if the others have noticed your new friend or not.

#### Hot Exit (Exit while fighting)
You start to sprint out into the swamp, weaving between mindless drafted lunging for you - behind you you can hear the yells of orders and marching feet but if any of you glance back, it doesn't look like you're being pursued. Instead you see soldiers lining the walls and mouth of camp.

**Long Version - Combat Rules** 
	The cave is about 3 rounds away if you all dash - or 6 if you want to take the dodge action on each of your turns. Dodging gives advantage on dex saves and enemies disadvantage to hit.
	*Each round a hale of arrows is released*
		DC 14 dex save and take 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each round the DC decreases by 1.
	*Every other round 2 Ballista Shots are fired (optional)* - 
		Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 1d10 piercing damage

**Short Version - Non Combat Rules**
	As you're running you hear Firestar's roar and a volley of arrows hale from the sky 
		*DC 12 dex save and take 3d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.*
	You keep running - the yelling getting further and further away, and the hale of arrows thinning out as you get too far for them to hit anymore


#### The Cave
**PLAYER ACTION:** 
> Do they enter the cave? or do they try to go elsewhere? If they try elsewhere the figure will try to charm them, they must make a wisdom saving throw +15 to defeat it?

Each of you comes barrelling through the cave as a result of the speeds at which you've been running at, the entrance is then sealed off by some tumbling rocks that you're not quite sure how they got there in the first place ...  Now everything has gone dark, the cave reeks of iron and for those of you without dark vision you're struggling to get a sense of direction in here. The is however, the soft glow of a green light coming from around the corner.  In the distance you hear a peculiar warping sound, followed by a familiar voice - cue thatcher's one liner or something:

**THATCHER:** "Hi! I'm Thatcher, rat catcher and cat snatcher! I snatch the cats who catch the rat cuz rats make for tasty snacks!"

# Crossing the Bridge to Necropolis
### Hot Exit
The gate slams shut behind you with a heavy clank, and you can hear yelling and clamouring of guards. Before you is a river running deep and green, a simple wooden bridge shows your path to freedom as a wide valley of buildings, all different sizes and shapes, bathed in golden light lay before you. 

You don't have time to enjoy the sight however as arrows begin to fly
		*DC 12 dex save and take 3d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.*

You start running - the yelling getting further and further away, and the hale of arrows stopping as you cross the the other side of the bridge.

You hear a clank of the gate rising again
**Player Action:**
> Do you look back? You see Firestar holding the gate above his head, dropping it back down behind him the a thud.

Leave of here for chase sequence next session?

### Stealth Exit
Before you is a river running deep and green, a simple wooden bridge shows your path to freedom as a wide valley of buildings, all different sizes and shapes, bathed in golden light lay before you. Through the whispering current of the water you can hear laughter and music in the distance.
