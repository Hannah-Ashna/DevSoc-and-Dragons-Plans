# All things return to Tavern
```PLAY ARTIST'S GARRET```
Last week we left our brave adventurers in the company of [[Mokat Irai the Necromancer|Mok]], the Harengon as he freed himself of his trinket form and conjured up a little safe space for our party outside the gates of the Watcher's Camp to have a nice little short rest. The manager, AKA a brain in a jar mentioned that each of you died during battle and thus are now being enlisted as new recruits for deaths army. With your new uniforms in hand and your lives on the line -- perhaps it's time to suit up for your next mission. Though ... you can't help but linger on the thought of how you came to be here. Unfortunately, for each of you your memory is foggier than the ocean you crossed to get here. The furthest thing in your memory that you can recall is a pedestal out in a white desert. 

Morning in the underworld feels surprisingly pleasant as the warm rays of light come shining through the windows of Mok's little portable tavern. Each of you is woken up from your little nap with the comforting smell of a hot breakfast. Mok seems to be busy in the kitchen, cooking up something that smells rather good. All of your stomachs growl simultaneously, forming a cacophony of sounds which startles Mok.

**MOK:** "Ah .. I see you're all awake ... hopefully a little bit better rested after all that dungeon crawling you've had to do ..." 

Mok serves you each a nice warm bowl of .... uh .... _something???_ it looks like food but you're not entirely sure what this slop is meant to be. 
It smells delicious though ... 

>**PLAYER ACTION:** 
>Do you try the food? (If yes it heals them up completely) 
>If they ask what's in it just list off a bunch of really weird items
>If they ask what it's called just call it something absurd

As each of you scoffs down your meal, Jeremy you notice Mok's face turn a little solemn as he looks over at each of your arms. 

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Roll an insight check to see whether you can figure out why? (Anything above a 10 succeeds)
>You get the feeling that he feels sorry for all of you ... you can't tell whether this means you all might not make it back to the land of the living ...
>Rolls - 19 or 20 - His mind seems to be running on overdrive, perhaps formulating a plan for what to do next and how to get each of you past this camp ...

Mok finally speaks up ...
**MOK:** "We're running out of time ... and quickly" 

He says this while gesturing at your arms -- you notice that about almost a third of the sand in the hourglass has fallen to the base ...

**MOK:** "Fortunately, since you're all now marked as 'dead' within the system you might be able to smooth talk your way through this camp. However, to my knowledge Death's best generals occupy this area"

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
>Just an opportunity for players to ask questions if needed or derail probably

**MOK:** "Anyway ... focusing on the mission at hand, there is only one exit when you enter the Watcher's camp. It will lead you into Necropolis, the city of the underworld. This is where the gateway to Death's personal fortress is.

You'll need to get through your base training to earn your passes that'll give you free travel across this land. Death's soldiers tend to roam about these days ..."

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Maybe some more discussion on the dumb shit they'll wanna do before arriving
> Do they put on their uniforms?

# Watchers Camp
```PLAY CLASH OF KINGS```
Upon exiting Mok's cozy tavern and basking underneath the sunlight of the underworld, you all watch as Mok gestures grandly and the tavern fizzles out of existence. Mok then assumes the form of the trinket around Jo's neck. Up ahead, is your next challenge, getting past the tight security to get to the gate that leads to Necropolis. 

As you all make your way up towards the fortress you cross over a small stream using a rickety old bridge. In front of the fortress stands two satyr guards. Each of them gives you all a quick glance and then a cheeky grin at each other before one yells out loud.

**GUARD 1:** "HALT! This area is restricted access ... though from the looks of yous I think we've got ourselves some fresh MEAT!"

**GUARD 2:** "Ahh been a while since the manager sent us over some new recruits, I wonder if you be capable or not ..."

**GUARD 1:** "One of us always tells the truth, while the other always lies ... you may ask us a single question... pick out the liar and you shall gain entry into the camp. Fail to do so and we'll happily send you to the Sanguine Swamps"

The second guard nods profusely at this.

>**PLAYER ACTION:**
> So what is your question?
> SOLUTION: They're both fuckin liars -- and kinda stupid if they get caught out they should just bicker about who was meant to be the truth teller that time

Just as you're about to meet your fate a commanding voice calls out, followed by the metallic clanks of a suit of armour. In front of you is a 6ft tall Leonin warrior clad in the finest suit of armour you have ever seen. He greets each of you with a gentle smile before turning to the two Satyrs. You all watch as his smile fades into a terrifying scowl. It appears a lecture is about to begin ...

**FIRESTAR:** "Would you PLEASE stop harassing all our new recruits with your ridiculous riddles ... I'm sure my assessment methods are enough to weed out the unworthy and yet here you are wasting my time and Deaths ... perhaps it would do you some good to sit out in those swamps for a day or two on the night shift!"

The two satyrs start to tremble a little as their apologies come pouring out. 

**FIRESTAR:** "Alright enough ... get on with it you two.."

and off they go, leaving the four of you in the company of this Leonin. He sighs to himself before turning back to face all of you.

**FIRESTAR:** "Where are my manners! I am Firestar, Lieutenant Commander of Death's army here in the underworld. I oversee the training of fresh new recruits so we'll have the chance to get to know each other a little better over these next few weeks. Now ... come, come ... we have plenty to do to get you all set up"

He beckons all of you into the camp...

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>  Do you enter with him? Do you say anything else? Ask him anything else?

# The Fight
```PLAY ENDGAME```
As you enter the camp you feel the ground tremble as large groups of troops march about the area in unison. The sounds of soldier chanting out loud are mixed together with the clangs of metal clashing against each other in the distance. However, the blaring sounds aren't enough to drown out what you're quite sure is wailing and screaming in the distance. Perhaps it's coming from their infirmary. 

The buildings here feel rather bland, with their wooden rooftops and dirty concrete walls. You suspect these were white at some point but who cares for walls when you have swords to sharpen and foes to behead. 

Firestar leads all of you through an arched doorway and into a magnificent circular courtyard that's open to the skies. It looks to be some sort of minitature arena. He shuts the door behind all of you once you're in and locks it. 

**FIRESTAR:** "Forgive me for putting each of you on the spot like this but the manager isn't known for her great taste in warriors ... According to your records you've all died in battle but I'm sure you know that any fool can die a mundane death in battle, it takes a great warrior to do so gloriously

Thus, we'll start our day off with a little bit of an assessment into your capabilities ... I have prepared a worthy opponent for you... _each other_."

**PLAYER ACTION:**
>  I'm gonna need you to ROLL INITIATIVE
>  If players decline to fight, Firestar he will just whoop their azz instead. We can cut this short depending on how long it's looking to take
>  If they fight, Firestar will heal them all up afterwards?

# The Tour
Firestar applauds all of you for your impressive performance, his grin widens and he nods approvingly. 

**FIRESTAR:** "Oh how I wish to have fought alongside you all in battle... Alright let's give you the tour of the place and show you what we do out here"

He will unlock the doorway to the training centre and lead you out into the camp. Your tour comprises of him showing you about the watchers camp alongside a brief lesson into the hierarchy of Death's Army. By the time you finally reach your final stop on the tour you're quite sure you've shaken at least a 100 different hands and met an array of different folks. Your pit stop at the cafeteria was probably the most exciting part of the tour since it came with free cookies. Firestar seems to ramble on about the two main types of soldiers ...

```PLAY SWAMPLANDIA```

**FIRESTAR:** "So you see you all are what we called the recruited, folks who were warriors in life and have elected to continue to be so in death and out here in the Sanguine swamps is where we get the drafted, individuals who were bad in life and thus sent to these swamps and forced to repent. If they are 'ready' we then come out here and pick them up to begin their training. Be warned though, even a day out here can turn you into a mindless zombie ..."

You now all stand before the border between the swamp and the camp. The sound of wailing and shrieking is almost deafening. The swamp land is bathed in bloodied earth and in the distance you notice heads popping up from beneath the ground, covered in red vines. The air here is putrid from the rotting flesh. 

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> The smell is so overbearing and thus, can each of you please make a con save to see whether you throw up or not? (12 and above they save)

Firestar chuckles softly to himself before freezing and locking eyes with something behind you Faye. You watch as Firestar's gaze slowly moves down to your arm, his eyes widen in disbelief and in a split second you hear the whizzing of a flare ascend into the sky and crackle up above. The booming sound of sirens begin to set off as you watch soldiers in the distance scatter all about to get a closer look. In a matter of minutes you four are now surrounded by soldiers as their blades and spells lock onto. There is disappointment in Firestar's eyes. His expression is a solemn one.

**FIRESTAR:** "Unfortunately, I think we'll have to cut your training session here a little short ... I've seen that marking before and I'm not stupid. We've had plenty of the likes of yous come around trying to kill Death and I won't let you. Perhaps you can sit out there in the company of the drafted as you contemplate your heinous sin.

Did no one tell you that when you aren't really dead it isn't easy to fake it? I could smell it on you ... that flowery scent of the living ... but I thought it might've been a mistake ... but the drafted don't make mistakes and look at how many you four have woken up ... "

Firestar gestures out behind you and and beyond the armed soldiers keeping you in place, in that bloodied swamp you see dozens upon dozens of zombies crawling towards you.

**FIRESTAR:** "They want what you have ... so I'm sure you'll have a great time fighting them off when we bury each of you in the swamp ground and perhaps if you survive that we'll reconsider your role with us."

As Firestar is just about to continue, you hear another voice clear his throat and the crowd of soldiers parts to make way for an even more impressive figure than Firestar. 

**FIRESTAR:** "Commander Arbuckle! Apologies you see we've had a little incident ..."

The curly brown-haired human man cuts Firestar off and looks over at you Jeremy. He tilts his head inquisitively ...

**ARBUCKLE:** "You wouldn't happen to be a descendant of Vekron ... would you?"

**PLAYER ACTION:**
> Jeremy, all of a sudden your mind begins to overflow with memories of your family... you're starting to remember who you are a little bit.
> Do you answer his question?
> If he says yes - Arbuckle is lenient and decides to imprison them 
> If he says no - Arbuckle reiterates that he is quite sure Jeremy is and will chose to imprison them instead to live out their remaining days of life.
> 
> Players can make a history check (+14) to figure out who the fuck this guy even is - He is a man of myth, the original warrior to imprison Octogarf beneath Snottingham many moons ago. He has a great appreciation for all those that fought against that horrifying monstrosity and it appears he might have a soft spot for Jeremy if he is indeed who he thinks he is.
