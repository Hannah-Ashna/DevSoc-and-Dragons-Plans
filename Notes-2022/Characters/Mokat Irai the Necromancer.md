### Introduction
Mokat Irai is perhaps one of the most powerful necromancers of his time. Mokat's name loosely translates to the Lord of Frauds or the Ultimate Liar. He prides himself in his ability to deceive and manipulate and thus, chose this name for himself when he was 'reborn' as a necromancer. 

Mok has only one goal at the moment and that's to kill the God of Death and steal the throne to become the ultimate necrolord, the king of kings, the ruler of the dead. However, his magical prowess can only get him so far, Death is aware of his antics and has set aside many a hurdle. As he sits trapped within purgatory mulling over a new plan it seems a few foolish adventurers have decided to make an appearance.

### Appearance
Before you stands a small, lithe rabbit-man - otherwise known as a Harengon. He has light brown fur, slightly grey around the whiskers. His long, floppy ears hang from under a white Stetson. He wears a suede waistcoat, belt with a golden buckled engraved with a moth decal, and a bolo tie that looks like a star shaped flower (nightshade). He speaks with a charming, rustic tone that's capable of wooing all that have the pleasure of meeting him. 

### Mok's Lies
### The Backstory
"I was once the righteous cleric of Death and like many a faithful servant to their God, would be willing to sacrifice myself for the greater good. However, one night I made a fatal mistake... I saved the life of another that I could not bear to lose which Death proclaimed was an act against nature. This betrayal was not to go unpunished and so I was dragged out of the land of the living and banished to purgatory as punishment for my sin against God."

#### The Initial Manipulation
"Based on the symbol that's been branded onto each of you, I do believe you've been given a few days left to live. I assume you've made some sort of deal in your lifetime right before coming here? 

**The symbol is of an hourglass with sand slowly trickling down**

You haven't? Ah then there's been a mistake!"

"You'll need to venture further north to meet with Death and bargain for the return of your lives. You must be careful though, this realm does not take too kindly to those who are of flesh and bone still ... you may be teetering on the edge of death but all of you still reek of life and those darn soldiers will be about to sniff you out. 

I can accompany you but I'll have to assume the form of some sort of trinket so I can avoid detection. If Death were to find out I've left purgatory I fear my soul would pay the ultimate price and cease to exist... Perhaps in joining you for this journey I too will be able to ask Death for forgiveness! and even redeem myself for my sin."
