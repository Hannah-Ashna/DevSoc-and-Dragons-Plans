Sat on a oak desk scattered with papers is a glass jar. In it bubbles a strange green liquid, in which bobs a brain. The large cork sealing the jar is held tightly by thorny red vines that drip down the sides of the glass. Someone has painted a pair of glasses and a tie onto the front of the jar. 

And as all of you come to a halt in front of the desk, each of you hears a raspy voice echo in your mind.
