Sat on a oak desk scattered with papers is a glass jar. In it bubbles a strange green liquid, in which bobs a brain. The large cork sealing the jar is held tightly by thorny red vines that drip down the sides of the glass. Someone has painted a pair of glasses and a tie onto the front of the jar. 

And as all of you come to a halt in front of the desk, each of you hears a raspy voice echo in your mind.

* HR? Oh it stands for hellish resources ...
* We needed to test your capabilities as future soldiers of death!
* I'm sending you to the watchers camp to complete your on-boarding 
* You've passed the interview with flying colours ... huh it says here you're not really dead but ah I think that's a mistake

**If players try to correct jar head they just hear a snap and BAM they're stood outside this massive fortress and we end there**
