On the desk sits a glass jar, in it bubbles a strange green liquid, in which bobs a brain. The large cork sealing the jar is held tightly on by thorny red vines that drip down the sides of the glass. Someone has painted a pair of glasses and a tie on the front of the jar. 

All of you hear a raspy voice echo in your mind.
