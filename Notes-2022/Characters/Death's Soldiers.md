Deaths army is made up of two groups;
- The Recruited - those who were warriors in life and choose to continue to be in death
- The Drafted - were bad in life and tortured in the sanguine swamps for centuries until they accepted what they did wrong - now mindless zombie soldiers

1st in command = Commander Arbuckle - Human Man with curly brown hair
2nd in command = Lieutenant Commander Firestar - Leonin Warrior (afraid of Thatcher)
