### Introduction
Deaths army is made up of two groups:
- **The Recruited** - these individuals were warriors in life and have elected to continue to be so in death
- **The Drafted** - these individuals were bad in life and tortured in the sanguine swamps for centuries until they accepted what they did wrong - now mindless zombie soldiers

### Hierarchy
1st in command = Commander Arbuckle - Human Man with curly brown hair
2nd in command = Lieutenant Commander Firestar - Leonin Warrior (afraid of Thatcher)

### Stat Block
The Drafted zombies move with a jerky, uneven gait. They are clad in the moulding apparel they wore when put to rest, and carry the stench of decay.
