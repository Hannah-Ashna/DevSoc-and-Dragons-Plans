### Introduction
The Ferryman can only be described as an intimidating figure dressed in a heavy white velvet cloak with a faint golden glow that emanates from under their hood that obscures their face. The longer you try to look at them, the fuzzier your vision grows and the more your ears ring. The bottom of the cloak seems to effortlessly float above the ground as the figure looms over you at 7 ft tall. The figure seems to be holding onto a long obsidian glass staff that sparkles as the light touches it -- emanating some sort of mystical energy.

Their boat is a long gondola, made of clear glass, and inlaid with obsidian patterns too intricate for you to comprehend. At the foot of it is a lantern, lit with a similar golden light. 

### Other Roles
#### The Receptionist
The receptionist looks to be the same ferryman, except as you look at them now you get the intense feeling they are wearing a tie and glasses.

#### The Guard
