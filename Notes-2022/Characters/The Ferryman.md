### Introduction
A figure in heavy white velvet cloak, a faint golden glow emanates from under their hood but their face is obscured. The longer you try to look at them, the fuzzier your vision grows and the more your ears ring. The bottom of cloak seems to float above the ground, the figure them self towering over you at 7ft tall. They are holding a long staff made of obsidian.

Their boat is a long gondola, made of clear glass, and inlaid with obsidian patterns too intricate for you to comprehend. At the foot of it is a lantern, lit with a similar golden light.
