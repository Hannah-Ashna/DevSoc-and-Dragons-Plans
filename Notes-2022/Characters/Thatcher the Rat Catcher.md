### Introduction
" Hello! I'm Thatcher, rat catcher and cat snatcher! I snatch the cats who catch the rat cuz rats make for tasty snacks!"

Stood in the mouth of a dark alley is a preteen boy in a faded white shirt and tweed shorts, held up with suspenders. His mousy brown hair is tucked into a flat cap. He has a satchel bag and a net strapped to his back. He looks up at you with a big grin. There's a smudge of dirt on his cheek. 

### Things to do
- God of Rat Catchers (and Cat Snatching)
- If any of them have or are a cat he will attempt to steal them
